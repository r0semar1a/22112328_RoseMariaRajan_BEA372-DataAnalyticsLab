# Bank Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code that analyzes a bank dataset and performs various operations such as printing headers, counting customers in different marital categories, and creating a histogram for customer ages.

## Code Explanation

The code in this repository performs the following tasks:

### Q1 - Opening the File

The code opens the bank dataset file located at `C:/Users/rosem/Downloads/christ/Semester 3/Data Analytics/bank.csv` and reads its contents.

### Q2 - Printing the Headers

The code reads the first line of the file, which contains the headers, and prints them.

### Q3 - Counting Customers in Each Marital Category

The code reads the remaining lines of the file and counts the number of customers in each marital category. It distinguishes between married and single customers.

### Q4 - Creating a Histogram for Age

The code extracts the ages of the customers from the dataset and creates a histogram by dividing the ages into classes of a 10-year interval.
